# INDUSTRY TALK 1 - PPG

On 20 November 2025, I had the opportunity to attend my first industrial talk hosted by PPG. The session was an eye-opening experience that gave me a clearer understanding of how a multinational company operates and how important ICT is in supporting business activities on a global scale.

During the talk, the speakers shared valuable insights into how technology is used to ensure smooth and efficient operations across different regions. One of the key topics discussed was the use of data analytics to support informed decision-making, identify potential risks, and improve overall operational efficiency. This helped me understand how data plays a crucial role in driving business strategies. In addition, the speakers explained how cloud infrastructure enables continuous and reliable global operations, allowing companies to stay connected and productive at all times. The role of enterprise systems such as SAP was also highlighted, particularly in managing daily business processes and ensuring consistency across departments.

The session was led by experienced professionals from PPG, including Ooi Ai Ling, Associate Director and APAC IT Lead; Derrick Tan Horng Shi, Data Analytics Manager; Vijaykumar Dhandapani, Cloud CoE Architect; and Patrick Thong, SAP CoE Operations and DTR Lead for APAC. Their real-world experiences and practical examples made the session engaging and easy to understand.

Overall, this industrial talk was very meaningful as it helped bridge the gap between what I learn academically and how it is applied in the industry. It also motivated me to further improve my technical and professional skills in preparation for future career opportunities.
